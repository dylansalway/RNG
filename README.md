I think my final codes reflect random number generation well. Originally, I was meant to be doing machine learning however due to issues with my laptop installing packages and virtual environments, I could not get tensorflow nor pytorch to work for me. This led to a last-minute change on my project however I think turned out quite positively. However, I also think that given the time these codes could be improved a significant amount without a lot of work.
